Explore US Bikeshare Data

In this project, we use data provided by a bike share system provider in the United States to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compare the system usage between three cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC.
We compute statistics for the following topics:
* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info
Thw program shows statistics based on the user's inputs.

### Files
**bikeshare.py** 
Kindly run the python script to use the program and follow the instructions on the console.
Please note that the following files need to be in the same directory as the script for the program to run correctly:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
